# Softnet

Softnet is a software networking for [Tart](https://github.com/cirruslabs/tart) which provides better network isolation and alleviates DHCP shortage on production systems.
Please check out [this blog post](https://cirrus-ci.org/blog/2022/07/07/isolating-network-between-tarts-macos-virtual-machines/) for backstory.

This is its fork specific to our usage in EAS Build.

## Working model

Softnet solves two problems:

1. VM network isolation
  * [`VZNATNetworkDeviceAttachment`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/vznatnetworkdeviceattachment) (the default networking in Tart) enables [vmnet's bridge isolation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vmnet/vmnet_enable_isolation_key) by default and prevents cross-VM traffic, however it's still possible for any VM to spoof the host's ARP-table and capture other VMs traffic
2. DHCP exhaustion
  * macOS built-in DHCP-server allocates a `/24` subnet with 86400 seconds lease time by default, which only allows for ~253 VMs a day (or 1 VM every ~6 minutes) to be spawned without causing a denial-of-service, which is pretty limiting for CI services like Cirrus CI

And assumes that:

1. Tart gives it's VMs unique MAC-addresses
2. macOS built-in DHCP-server won't re-use the IP-addresses from it's pool until their lease expire

...otherwise it's possible for two VMs to receive an identical IP-address from the macOS built-in DHCP-server (even in the presence of Softnet's packet filtering) and thus bypass the protections offered by Softnet.

## Installing

For proper functioning, Softnet binary requires two things:

* a [SUID-bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid#SUID) to be set on the binary or a [passwordless sudo](https://serverfault.com/questions/160581/how-to-setup-passwordless-sudo-on-linux) to be configured, which effectively gives the binary `root` privileges
  * these privileges are needed to create [`vmnet.framework`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/vmnet) interface and perform DHCP-related system tweaks
  * the privileges will be dropped automatically to that of the calling user (or those represented by the `--user` and `--group` command-line arguments) once all of the initialization is completed
* the binary to be available in `PATH`
  * so that the Tart will be able to find it

## Running

Softnet is started and managed automatically by Tart if `--net-softnet` flag is provided when calling `tart run`.
